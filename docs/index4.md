## LinkedList

<p> One disadvantage of using arrays to store data is that arrays are static structures and therefore cannot be easily extended or reduced to fit the
data set. Arrays are also expensive to maintain new insertions and deletions. </p> 

The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on
demand. Each node of a linked list is made up of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null.
The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the first
node. If the list is empty then the head is a null reference.
